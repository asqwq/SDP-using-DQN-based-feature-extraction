# SDP-using-DQN-based-feature-extraction
# The Correlation coefficient between metric elements folder is the calculation result of correlation degree
# The NASA and promise datasets folder is a dataset
# Ranking of importance of metric elements folder is the ranking result
#The DQN-SDP folder is the code, where ch2, ESE2, PCA, IG are feature selection algorithms, DQNFeatureSelect is our feature selection algorithm, 
BalanceCascade and SMOTE are the class imbalance processing algorithms mentioned in the paper, related is the correlation code,
and the remaining are binary verification codes
